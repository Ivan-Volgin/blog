## Monday

This week was extremely busy because the May holidays came. I spent Monday in St. Petersburg. There are no distance couples today, so I just relaxed and walked around St. Petersburg.

## Tuesday.

Tuesday was the 9th of May. Happy Holidays to all! Also spent it in St. Petersburg. I slept through all the parades, but had a good walk, went to Lakhta center and visited an amusement park near it. It had this amazing roller coaster. I was happy with it, but it cost a lot of money.

## Wednesday

I went back to Moscow, but I slept through my classes. But I had a good time in the co-working room and did a lot of useful things. Didn't waste the day.

## Thursday ##

Thursday was just like Thursday. Everything is business as usual. Couples in the morning, couples in the afternoon, and co-working in the evening.

## Friday ##

There's always a lot of English on Friday, but it doesn't seem to discourage it. On the contrary, in fact. I like the language, although I don't know it perfectly. There's a lot to strive for. Going home in the evening.

## Saturday

Saturday was also an unremarkable Saturday. I did my homework all day and am still doing it at the moment.
