## Monday

The week began with two lectures on basic programming and mathematical logic. I went to bed at 4 am that day, so I attended the lectures formally. I didn't learn anything, but that's okay. I could figure it out that way.

## Tuesday

Tuesday was productive. I slept through classes, but that didn't stop me from getting a lot done. I'll give those days a kudos.

## Wednesday ##

Today's day. Doing an individual project today since Saturday is my brother's birthday. Had analytic geometry colloquium today and it went great. I got a 10 out of 10. I have a lot of plans for today, so it promises to be a productive day as well.

## Thursday ##

Thursday will probably be like Thursday. Can't say anything about the day.

## Friday ##

Friday is the day we sit at the university until 7:20 p.m. in English. It's become a no-brainer because it's getting late dark outside and the weather is beautiful. And no, I'm not going away to Vladimir, because Saturday is history, I'll be preparing a report in the evening.

## Saturday

Happy Birthday bro!!! The man is turning 19 years old. I hope you will join me in congratulating him. Plan for the day: go to the story, tell the first report, run to the train, and get to Vladimir as soon as possible for his birthday. The evening will be beautiful.
