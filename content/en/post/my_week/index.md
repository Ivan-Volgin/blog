## Monday

There was only one class on Monday, where I gave my report. I never got a grade on it.The day continued with a long preparation for the upcoming math analysis quiz. I would have to solve some integrals.

## Tuesday

The day of the test came and I felt ready enough to write a satisfying score. In the end I was only able to write a list of table integrals. In the main part I started with the hardest and ended up not having enough time to solve the easy assignments, because there were 5 minutes left (spoiler: I solved the hard assignment wrong). Dear diary... I can't put into words the pain I felt today. 

## Wednesday

The results came back on the test paper, I got a 0). For the next two weeks getting ready to rewrite. Otherwise, a normal day.

## Thursday

The only interesting thing was that I was able to pass my programming technology assignment with a maximum score, but neither I nor the instructor understood how one piece of my code worked. There are a few hypotheses, next week it will become clearer. I hope I don't lose points because of this.

## Friday

This day is notable because I will finally go home to Vladimir, where I have not been for three weeks. I'll be there to celebrate my mother's birthday. The end of the week will be beautiful.

This concludes the description of my week.
