## Monday

The week started the way a normal university week starts. I barely woke up because yesterday (today) I sat up until 4 am doing my homework and watching youtube at the same time. The distance lectures started, which I listened to VERY carefully. After that I had to go to Moscow, because tomorrow are full-time classes, and I am at home, in Vladimir. 

## Tuesday

Tuesday was an unremarkable day. There were only two classes: calculus and computer algebra. The interesting thing is that we had a new math analysis instructor. The BRS changed again, which is good (for me).  

## Wednesday

On Wednesday we have only math. we got the results of the test in analytical geometry. To make a long story short, I'm off to rewrite. The next pair was mat logic. Cr again. This time I was better prepared and solved everything, hopefully correctly. I also decided to finally get some exercise and ran in the park for 40 minutes.

## Thursday

On this day I had to do a big homework on programming technologies. I almost did it, but I still had to finish it and hand it in next week. Then I had two lectures, I tried to stay awake and I almost made it (on angem for sure).

## Friday.

English Day is the name of Friday. It is because we have 3 classes in this subject today. Often near the end, I'll do anything to get them over with. It's worth noting that this time the class went a lot easier than usual. Probably because it got darker later in the day. At the end of the day I drove home to Vladimir. 

This concludes the description of my week.
