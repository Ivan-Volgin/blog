## Monday

I was in Moscow on Monday. Nothing remarkable happened, I studied all day.

## Tuesday

Tuesday was supposed to be a math analysis quiz, but it wasn't, so we got lucky. We got our results in Mathematical Logic, seems ok but could have been better. 

## Wednesday.

Wednesday had only one event, a quiz on analytic geometry. Wrote it well.

## Thursday

Thursday was also standard. I was able to understand programming techniques, which is good. Went to a lecture on calculus and spent the rest of the day in the co-working room.

## Friday

English day again. Only went to it. Three classes went well and at the end of the last one I handed in my essay okay. After that I went to Vladimir.

This concludes the description of my week.
